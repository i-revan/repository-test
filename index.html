        <h3>Today's Place</h3>
        <p class="heading">Can you swim in Pink Lake?</p>
        <p class="info1">Lake Hillier is a saline lake on the edge of Middle Island, the largest of the
            islands and islets that make up the Recherche Archipelago in the Goldfields-Esperance region, 
            off the south coast of Western Australia. It is particularly notable for its pink colour. 
            A long and thin shore divides the Southern Ocean (by some definitions, the Indian Ocean) from 
            the lake. <br> </p>
        <p class="info1"> Lake Hillier is about 600 metres (2,000 ft) in length by about 250 m (820 ft) in width.
            The lake is surrounded by a rim of sand and a dense woodland of paperbark and eucalyptus 
            trees with a narrow strip of sand dunes covered by vegetation separating its northern edge 
            from the northern coast of Middle Island. The most notable feature of the lake is its pink, 
            vibrant colour. The vibrant colour is permanent, and does not alter when the water is taken 
            in a container. The pink colour is believed to be due to the presence of the organism</p>
            <div class="combine">
            <p class="hillier"><img src="image/hillier.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p class="info2">Lake Hillier was visited by the Matthew Flinders' expedition on 15 January 1802. Flinders' 
                journal entries are considered to be the first written records of the lake. Flinders observed the pink 
                lake after ascending the island's highest peak (now called Flinders Peak), describing the lake as follows:
                In the north-eastern part was a small lake of a rose colour, the water of which, as I was informed by 
                Mr. Thistle who visited it, was so saturated with salt that sufficient quantities were crystallised near 
                the shores to load a ship.<br>
                Despite the high salt content levels (comparable to those of the Dead Sea), 
                Lake Hillier is safe to swim in. However, it is not advisable nor allowed without previous
                approval by the Western Australia Dept of Environment Conservation.
                There are very few ways to reach Lake Hillier. Aeroplane scenic flights are the most common 
                method, with six flights a day departing Esperance Airport, flying over Lake Hillier via the 
                nearby Cape Le Grand National Park. Cruises are also an option for passengers wanting to visit
                 the isolated lake, and surrounding forest area.The only living organisms in Lake Hillier are 
                 microorganisms including <em>Dunaliella salina</em>, red algae which cause the salt content in the lake 
                 to create a red dye which helps produce the colour, as well as red halophilic bacteria, bacterioruberin,
                  present in the salt crusts. Despite the unusual hue, the lake exhibits no known adverse effects upon 
                  humans. From above, the lake appears a solid bubble gum pink, but from the shoreline it appears more
                   of a clear pink hue. The shoreline is also covered in salt crust deposits. In 2016 scientists from 
                   the Extreme Microbiome Project conducted extensive microbiome and metagenomic DNA sequencing and 
                   detected Haloquadratum, Haloferax, Salinibacter, Halobacterium, Halogeometricum, and several other 
                   halophilic organisms. </p>
